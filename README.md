DSA CODE SNIPPETS

I was solving the assignments of MySirG's "Free DSA using Python" course. So, while coding the solution I tried to build habit of using git and pushing code to Github, which lead to the creation of this Github Repo.
                                                                                                                                                                  
ABOUT THE COURSE:

Sir explained every concept very clearly and even covered the depth of the topics. Even though the course is not about solving 1000s of DSA Problems but it teaches us to think and build logic. Sir encourage the viewers to first try to build logic themselves and then look for solutions.

Even though it is a free course, it consists of Assignments and their Video Solutions.
